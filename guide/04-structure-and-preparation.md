# Structure and Preparation

We believe that organizational learning from accidents comes from gathering
data about the accident, constructing a timeline, and bringing people involved
into a group discussion led by a skilled and neutral facilitator. While it’s
tempting to simply send a form for people to fill out over email, we’ve found
that approach to be void of the context and dialogue necessary for real
improvement. It’s important to gather in a room together and make the learning
dynamic, rather than static.

That being said, there are a few key elements of structuring and preparing for
your debriefing.

## Familiarize Yourself With the Timeline in Advance
Before the debriefing, facilitators need to get a sense of the flow of events,
without forming opinions about what happened. You’ll want to gather whatever
objective data[2][] is available and construct a timeline of events.

The initial timeline should be created by the people closest to the event.
Generally, they are responsible for coming up with the basic structure of a
timeline, which helps determine the boundaries of the event being discussed.
You’ll want to review this document to get an initial idea of where the
interesting communication patterns, decision points, observations, and actions
occurred so you can sketch out where to dive deeper in your debrief.

Prepping is mostly about setting yourself up to best manage your focus and the
group’s mental cycles during the debriefing itself. A big part of this is being
keenly aware of how meeting time is spent. The time set aside for the
debriefing meeting will always be arbitrary and it will never be enough to
cover everything. Learning can always go on forever! Reading through the
initial timeline beforehand will let you structure the meeting and guide the
discussion in a way that ensures you’ll get through everything.

smelled, tasted, counted, or measured (does not contain conjecture, conclusion
or opinion).” - (USDA Forest Service, 2014)

## Unearth More Objective and Subjective Data
The timeline provides widely accepted observations to use as a skeleton for the
debriefing.  Additional data that can help construct the timeline might include
chat transcripts capturing the dialogue between people attempting to coordinate
and respond to an event, dashboards, graphs or logs that people observed, the
timestamped actions people took during the event, etc.

As the debriefing progresses, you’ll use the timeline and the artifacts within
it to develop questions to ask. We’ll talk more about these questions in the
next section, but they represent prompts to gather subjective data that will
build context around the actions and decisions that took place.  Subjective
data includes the opinions, judgments, assumptions, beliefs, and individual
statements that will come to light during the debriefing.

The key idea is that when somebody says “X happened” you take the opportunity
to ask questions that provide context for X. Not everyone in the discussion
will come to the meeting knowing that context, so it’s important not to skip
over details as you walk through the timeline in the debriefing.  You’ll want
to make sure that everyone involved in this incident, especially
representatives with diverse perspectives, are invited to the debriefing and
that you talk to key stakeholders in advance.  Whom you deem as “key” is
specific to your organization. If you’re not sure, you should ask, because that
is also useful data! The person who requested or is organizing the debrief is
definitely key. The people closest to the action in the incident are also key.
Those folks also know the most about what was really going on, and therefore
might fear being blamed for it, if they haven’t already blamed themselves. Your
job as facilitator here is to make sure they feel safe sharing their story. You
want to get a sense of what they’re worried about, and what they’d like to
explore further, before you walk into the debriefing together.

## Talking to the People Who Would Usually Be Blamed Is Really Important
It’s crucial to establish a sense of trust with all participants up front. Find
out if they’ve been to a debriefing before. Try to gauge how much fear or
anxiety they’re feeling. You’ll want to tread with more sensitivity here. Some
of this might feel like therapy, and that’s OK. You want to set everyone up for
success in the debriefing, which means helping them feel at ease and reminding
them that feeling anxious or embarrassed is what makes them the best teachers
for their coworkers, who will almost certainly find themselves in similar
situations in the future.

Remind them that hindsight and all our after-the-fact knowledge of the outcome
is what makes their decisions or actions feel embarrassing.

Remind them that before the unexpected occurred, they were just doing normal
work on a normal day.

## Come up With Some Initial Questions
Think a little bit about the sorts of things you might want to talk about
(based on your reading of the timeline and your discussions with those
involved). Focus on open questions—ones that don’t have “yes” or “no” answers.
Make notes in the margin about what seem like important pivot points in the
timeline, and jot down questions that might draw out additional context from
people involved.  Doing this in advance can help you stay on track and
attentive during the debriefing itself.

## Documentation
One of the most important outcomes from any debriefing is the annotated
timeline of how the events during the incident happened, as agreed on by
everyone in the room. To this end, it is important to have a dedicated
note-taker. You as the facilitator will be plenty busy guiding the discussion,
digging deep on interesting events, and coming up with the questions that get
the room to understand what was really going on.

Etsy has created a tool called Morgue (Etsy, 2013) to aid us with the
documentation process. It’s a simple web application that allows for adding a
lot of metadata about an incident, as well as a timeline, graphs, images, and
chat logs related to what was going on. The format that will work for you is
largely dependent on what fits your organization best. Wiki pages or Google
docs can work just fine. Etsy’s debriefing documentation started as pages on
our internal wiki, but over time we built Morgue to better accommodate our
unique needs. We even built a “request a facilitator” button, and have added
Google Calendar integration so that scheduling the debriefing itself is part of
the tool’s workflow.

However you document the debriefing and related artifacts, it must be available
and accessible to everyone in the company. You need to make it very clear
before, during and after the facilitation that a debrief is a collaborative
process that benefits from everyone’s input.

Note: Not every organization will be comfortable with open access to debriefing
data. While this document cannot cover the complex dynamics of what constitutes
a “Just Culture”[3][], we believe this access is critical to the process.

## Setting Expectations
In order to make sure everybody in the room understands the importance and
goals of a debrief, the introduction you give at the beginning of the meeting
is key.

You have the job of simultaneously setting the agenda for the next hour or so,
while also getting people into the mindset for learning, which means making the
atmosphere feel as safe and welcoming as possible. **One of the hardest parts is
making everybody understand that we are not coming together to prevent a future
event from happening**. The things you are about to look into and find may very
well happen again. Preventing the future is not the goal—learning is. And to
that end, learning needs to be the focus of the whole debrief.

As mentioned before, there is a powerful tendency to try to find a single
simple solution that explains what happened. In the search for a cause of an
accident we tend to, in the words of Nietzsche, stop by “the first
interpretation that explains the unknown in familiar terms” and “to use the
feeling of pleasure… as our criterion for truth.” (Hollnagel, 2009)

So as the facilitator, you need to counter this most human urge to find a
single explanation and single fix for the incident. You can do this by giving a
brief introduction in the debrief to remind participants what you are all there
for: a semi-structured group interview. Nothing more.

## Structure of the Discussion
One of best ways to ensure you are following a path of exploration (instead of
looking for a single fix) is by sticking closely to the timeline. This makes
sure you get a representation of the past that everyone in the room agrees is
as close as possible to what really happened. Any remediation items based on a
less accurate version of how things went down will be less effective or even
obstructive.

Because reconstructing the timeline is your main task, you should focus the
majority of time in the debrief on doing just that, addressing remediation
items afterward. For a 60-minute meeting this can easily be 35–40 minutes of
discussion.

There will be many people who suggest remediations or fixes before the group
has finished walking through the timeline. This is inevitable, but these
contributions are less effective during this part of the debriefing. Your job
as the facilitator is to encourage people to write down any ideas for
improvement (sometimes known as “remediations”) that come up during the
timeline reconstruction, so they can bring them up later, after the timeline is
complete. More often than not, the unfolding of events in the timeline render
those initial remediation items moot when the full (or at least fuller) context
becomes clear. So let the room know there will be a time for remediation items
and to hold onto them until then.

After you have established the timeline, you want to make sure everybody agrees
that it is accurate and comprehensive. This means asking the room what’s
missing, if there’s anything you haven’t talked about, or if anything happened
differently than described so far.  Your next step is to pivot the conversation
toward what the group learned from going through the timeline, and to discover
more perspectives that can clarify or add additional context what’s been
written down. This is also when you’d invite everyone in the room to start
thinking about the learning points from the event. These can include
recommendations for remediation items, but shouldn’t be limited to them.

When you begin discussing learning points, encourage everyone to speak up if
anything comes to mind and to not censor themselves. You want the initial phase
to be more of a brainstorm. Nothing more, nothing less. Anything goes, because
we are looking for improvements to the current system, and trying to unearth
innovative ways to underpin the learnings from the meeting. However, you must
resist the urge to turn them into actionable tickets just yet. These learning
points are likely to come from all directions and appear haphazard. Some might
be very specific, others very broad, and some might apply to different systems
altogether.

Ultimately, you want to create remediations that are specific, measurable,
achievable, relevant and time-bound[4][], but don’t dismiss ideas that don’t
conform to that criteria right off the bat. Instead collect all the ideas as a
brainstorming list. Then choose a small set of people from the meeting who were
close to the incident and are familiar with the systems mentioned, tasking them
with taking the brainstorm list and dwelling on it for a bit.

[4]: For more information, see p. 81 (Dekker, 2014)

The idea behind dwelling on the recommendations for some time and developing
remediation items after the fact is to just be aware of them as suggestions and
keep them in the back of your mind to let them marinate. Then two or so (work)
days later, bring that group into a room to discuss the viability of those
remediation items. This way, what results are tasks that are effective and
logical and stand the test of time, rather than action items created in a rush
during the final moments of the debrief. The idea here is to give everybody
“soak time” to process the ideas that were brought up. The effect of suddenly
realizing the solution to a problem while you are distracted by something
completely unrelated is a well-documented phenomenon (Smith, 2016). Generally,
insights appear when we aren’t forcing them and we’re allowed to gain some
perspective over the issue at hand. And this is how you’re going to make sure
the remediation items that make it into the ticket queue are effective.

You might also want to remind everyone involved that having remediation items
is not a requirement for a good debriefing. If what a group learns during a
debriefing results in new ideas on how to make mistakes and accidents less
likely, that’s great. However, our experience at Etsy reveals that it can be
easy to generate ideas for remediations in an effort to satisfy the urge to “do
something” in the wake of a painful incident. But what’s often downplayed is
how the recommended fix might needlessly complicate, or even **increase**, the
likelihood of new types of accidents in the future.
